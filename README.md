# RUSD
> This app was developed for the Racine Unified School District teachers and staff. The district was looking to give teachers and staff an easier way to view important district information and alerts that could assist them in doing their jobs. The app was developed as a UW-Parkside App Factory project. A REST API (also developed by the App Factory) is consumed and provides push notifications to users based on their active directory group membership. The app also includes contact information for important department heads.

The app uses the following technologies/libraries/patterns:

* Firebase
* GSON
* Kotlin
* Fuel (HTTP Networking Library)
* Android Architecture Components (ViewModel/LiveData)
* MVVM Architecture
